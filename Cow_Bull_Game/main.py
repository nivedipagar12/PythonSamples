'''Title : Cow Bull Game
   Author : Nivedita Pagar
   Date : 09/04/2018
   Details : The code generates a random 4 digit number and asks user to guess it
             1) If a digit in the number guessed by the user is in the PC generated number, but at the wrong position,
                the code returns it as a 'COW'
             2) If a digit in the number guessed by the user is in the PC generated number, and at the correct position,
                the code returns it as a 'BULL'
             3) This continues until the user guesses the correct digits at correct positions (4 Bulls)

             Example: Randomly generated number = 5678
             User guess: 5897
             Result: 1 BULL and 2 COW
